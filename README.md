# 📊 AskCSV – LLM-Powered CSV Data Assistant

**AskCSV** is an AI-driven web app that lets users explore CSV datasets using natural language — no code required. Ask questions like:

- *"What are the top-selling products in Q2?"*
- *"Show me the total revenue by region."*

AskCSV turns your question into Python `pandas` code using OpenAI's GPT models via [PandasAI](https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai), and visualizes the output — soon with charts powered by `matplotlib` and `plotly`.
